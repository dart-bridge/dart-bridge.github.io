<p class="lead">
A full featured HTTP service layer is essential for a web app framework. Bridge provides a simple, yet scalable,
foundation for everything from a public JSON API to a large size web app. Powered by

<p>The request/response cycle is intuitive and familiar.</p>
<ol>
<li>A request comes in.</li>
<li>The request passes through middleware.</li>
<li>The Router delegates the request to the correct route, resolving the handler function through the
<a href="#/core/service-container">Service Container</a>.</li>
<li>The return value of the handler gets passed through modulators, which transforms whatever object was returned to
either a <code>shelf.Response</code>, a primitive value, or a JSON parsable value.</li>
<li>The response is cast to a <code>shelf.Response</code> (if it isn't already one) and passed back through the middleware.</li>
<li>The final response is sent to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any exception thrown by the Router or the route handler can be handled by registering an Exception Handler, which is
also resolved through the <a href="#/core/service-container">Container</a>.</p>
