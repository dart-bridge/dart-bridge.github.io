# Bridge Core Library <small>bridge.core</small>
<p class='lead'>
Bridge, at its core, really is nothing more than an empty shell. It is extended through what's called 
[Service Providers](/core/service-providers). Think of them as sockets that is used to connect a library or service to
the rest of the application.

Look at the figure below. It illustrates the structure of the `bridge.core` library. The three circles surrounded by the
faded blue circle is all there is to it.

From the left, we see the operating system (currently only Unix based systems are supported). The black circle is your
environment variables, which are registered in the Config.

We also see the entry point, `$ dart bridge`. The command will initialize the Bridge CLI. The CLI creates the
[Service Container](/core/service-container) and injects itself into it. The Config is also registered.

Then the [Service Container](/core/service-container) will run all registered
[Service Providers](/core/service-providers). They connect the service or library in question to the rest of the
application, using the [Service Container](/core/service-container).

The [Service Providers](/core/service-providers) can register commands in the CLI; an easy way to provide a UI for the
service.
