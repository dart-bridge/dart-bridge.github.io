# Command Line
<p class='lead'>
Traditionally, web apps have a single entry point – HTTP. With Bridge, though, that is not the case. The application is
started though the command line, and can be interacted with while it's running.
</p>

## The shell
Starting up Bridge is super simple:
```bash
$ dart bridge
```

At this point, the entire application will be bootstrapped, through what's called 
[Service Providers](/core/service-providers). When that is done, you'll see the Bridge shell indicator – an equals sign:

```bridge
= 
```

Now we're ready to interact with the running application. To see the available commands, type `help` or simply press
tab. Most of the commands are actually dynamically added by the [Service Providers](/core/service-providers), so if
you're missing a command, that's probably because you haven't registered the
[Service Provider](/core/service-providers) responsible for the command.

For now, let's focus on seeing something in the browser. That's easy, just type `start` and press <kbd>↵</kbd>.

```bridge
= start
Server started on http://localhost:1337
= 
```

> **Note:** The CLI supports command completion, so it might suffice to type `sta` and tap <kbd>⇥</kbd>.

Go ahead and visit that URL in the browser, and you should see the Bridge logo.

## Reloading
To see changes made to the server side source code, as well as templates, the application must be reloaded. Exiting and
restarting the program with `dart bridge` works, of course. But you can also use the `reload` command. Start the server
back up by once again running `start` (You can use the arrow keys to traverse your command history).

```bridge
= reload
Server stopped
= start
Server started on http://localhost:1337
= 
```

## Boot commands
An easy way to quickly get to work is starting the program will boot commands. Just append whatever commands you want
after `dart bridge`, separated by commas. The commands will execute in order.

```bash
$ dart bridge build, start
```

## Auto reloading
It might get tedious to go back to the command line every time you want to see a change in the browser. No sweat, Bridge
comes with a `watch` command. It will watch your entire working directory for changes and reload bridge automatically.
It will remember any boot commands you provided, so for a quick workflow, just run the following command and be on
your way:

```bash
$ dart bridge start, watch
```

To stop watching, just run `unwatch`.

## Exiting
Using <kbd>^C</kbd> to exit interrupts the app completely, making it impossible for the program to react to the fact
that it is being shut down. To gently exit the program, allowing the [Service Providers](/core/service-providers) to
tear down their service, you can either use the `exit` command, or the shortcut <kbd>^X</kbd>.
