<p class="lead">
Traditionally, web apps have a single entry point – HTTP. With Bridge, though, that is not the case. The application is
started though the command line, and can be interacted with while it's running.
</p>

<h2 id="the-shell">The shell</h2>
<p>Starting up Bridge is super simple:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bash prettyprinted" data-lang="bash" style=""><span class="pln">$ dart bridge</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the entire application will be bootstrapped, through what's called 
<a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a>. When that is done, you'll see the Bridge shell indicator – an equals sign:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bridge prettyprinted" data-lang="bridge" style=""><span class="lit">=</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we're ready to interact with the running application. To see the available commands, type <code>help</code> or simply press
tab. Most of the commands are actually dynamically added by the <a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a>, so if
you're missing a command, that's probably because you haven't registered the
<a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Provider</a> responsible for the command.</p>
<p>For now, let's focus on seeing something in the browser. That's easy, just type <code>start</code> and press <kbd>↵</kbd>.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bridge prettyprinted" data-lang="bridge" style=""><span class="lit">=</span><span class="pln"> start
Server started on http://localhost:1337
</span><span class="lit">=</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CLI supports command completion, so it might suffice to type <code>sta</code> and tap <kbd>⇥</kbd>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and visit that URL in the browser, and you should see the Bridge logo.</p>
<h2 id="reloading">Reloading</h2>
<p>To see changes made to the server side source code, as well as templates, the application must be reloaded. Exiting and
restarting the program with <code>dart bridge</code> works, of course. But you can also use the <code>reload</code> command. Start the server
back up by once again running <code>start</code> (You can use the arrow keys to traverse your command history).</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bridge prettyprinted" data-lang="bridge" style=""><span class="lit">=</span><span class="pln"> reload
Server stopped
</span><span class="lit">=</span><span class="pln"> start
Server started on http://localhost:1337
</span><span class="lit">=</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="boot-commands">Boot commands</h2>
<p>An easy way to quickly get to work is starting the program will boot commands. Just append whatever commands you want
after <code>dart bridge</code>, separated by commas. The commands will execute in order.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bash prettyprinted" data-lang="bash" style=""><span class="pln">$ dart bridge build</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> start</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="auto-reloading">Auto reloading</h2>
<p>It might get tedious to go back to the command line every time you want to see a change in the browser. No sweat, Bridge
comes with a <code>watch</code> command. It will watch your entire working directory for changes and reload bridge automatically.
It will remember any boot commands you provided, so for a quick workflow, just run the following command and be on
your way:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-bash prettyprinted" data-lang="bash" style=""><span class="pln">$ dart bridge start</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> watch</span></code></pre>
<p>To stop watching, just run <code>unwatch</code>.</p>
<h2 id="exiting">Exiting</h2>
<p>Using <kbd>^C</kbd> to exit interrupts the app completely, making it impossible for the program to react to the fact
that it is being shut down. To gently exit the program, allowing the <a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a> to
tear down their service, you can either use the <code>exit</code> command, or the shortcut <kbd>^X</kbd>.</p>
