<p class="lead">
Bridge, at its core, really is nothing more than an empty shell. It is extended through what's called 
<a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a>. Think of them as sockets that is used to connect a library or service to
the rest of the application.
</p>

<p>Look at the figure below. It illustrates the structure of the <code>bridge.core</code> library. The three circles surrounded by the
faded blue circle is all there is to it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/services-figure.svg" alt="Bridge Services"></p>
<p>From the left, we see the operating system (currently only Unix based systems are supported). The black circle is your
environment variables, which are registered in the <a href="#/docs/core/config">Config</a>.</p>
<p>We also see the entry point, <code>$ dart bridge</code>. The command will initialize the Bridge CLI. The CLI creates the
<a href="#/docs/core/service-container">Service Container</a> and injects itself into it. The <a href="#/docs/core/config">Config</a> is also
registered.</p>
<p>Then the <a href="#/docs/core/service-container">Service Container</a> will run all registered
<a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a>. They connect the service or library in question to the rest of the
application, using the <a href="#/docs/core/service-container">Service Container</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a> can <a href="#/docs/cli/custom-commands">register commands</a> in the CLI; an easy way
to provide a UI for the service.</p>
