      <h2 class='q'>Does Bridge work on Windows?</h2>

      <p class='a'>
        Sadly, no. Not currently. The library used to create the Bridge shell does not play well with Windows. This
        will change in the future. For now, Mac and Linux have support.
      </p>

      <h2 class='q'>Why should I use Bridge instead of other Dart server frameworks?</h2>

      <p class='a'>
        The most popular packages for creating server side apps in Dart are all very low level, meaning they leave a lot
        of technical details exposed to the developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bridge provides clean and easy-to-use high level abstractions of the concepts, leaving all the technical details
        out of the way from the real work the developer want to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, you can still access the low level details. But they are optional, and if you don't need to change
        the default behaviour, you don't have to care about them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="q">Does Bridge work well with X?</h2>

      <p class="a">
        Bridge is a modular system, and only the <a href="#/docs/core/overview">core library</a> is needed to use a
        Bridge app. Every other functionality can be disabled and/or replaced with another package from Pub. If a
        package works in another app, it works in Bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Bridge's <a href="#/docs/core/service-container">Service Container</a>, external library classes are
        instantly available for use in <a href="#/docs/core/service-providers">Service Providers</a> and
        <a href="#/docs/http/router">routes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> <code>bridge.http</code> is based on
        <a href="//pub.dartlang.org/packages/shelf">Shelf</a>, so any middleware should work out of the box. Check
        out the <a href="#/docs/http/middleware">docs</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="q">Why doesn't Bridge provide a front end templating framework?</h2>

      <p class="a">
        Currently, there are lots of great front end frameworks out there, like
        <a href="//polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>. Bridge doesn't force you in any direction. The
        Tether is available globally as <code>tether</code>, and can be used in any context.
        That's all Bridge does right now.
